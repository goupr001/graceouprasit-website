        <p class="lead mb-4">Grace Ouprasit is a full-time student, volunteer, community service enthusiast, and amateur dessert critic. She is currently a second-year student at the University of California, Riverside, studying to pursue her bachelorâ€™s degree in Economics Admin Studies with a concentration in Human Resource Management. In addition to studying, Grace is also involved in several clubs both on and off campus. She enjoys giving back and interacting with the individuals in her local community. Through her clubs, she is able to participate in city wide community service acts such as park clean ups and food drives. During these events especially, Grace is able to utilize the countless different skill sets she has acquired throughout her studies, such as managing and organizing events and the individuals involved in it. Building team relations and connections with people of all kinds is one of Graceâ€™s favorite things during these events. Not only does it build a better and stronger community, but it also provides an incentive for these individuals to continue their good deeds. Since high school, Grace has been very involved and interested with bettering her soundings and spreading positivity wherever she was. For example, for two years in a row, Grace was in charge of organizing bi-annual blood drives with the American Red Cross. Since then she has developed a passion for planning, organizing and executing events that not only better the society but make individuals feel better by helping too. Nonetheless, she is always open to learning new things, hearing of different perspectives, and bettering herself as an individual. 
<br><br>

        When she is not busy with school work, club activities or at work, you can find her shopping for new clothes, trying new food places, painting, or at home baking desserts. It can be noted that Grace enjoys activities that allow her to be expressive and creative in her own way. Even when she is just going out for a quick snack, she enjoys documenting, illustrating and sharing her opinions through her social media platform. Being creative while still reaching other people is the balance she always strives for. <br><br>

       Coming from a mixed background of Chinese, Laotian and Hmong, Grace is multilingual, she can read and write in Chinese as well as speak two different dialects. She is unable to fluently speak Lao, but she can understand basic words and phrases. Being of mixed ethnicities herself, Grace is able to connect with countless people and break down language barriers between certain individuals. She largely enjoys learning about different cultures and customs of the people all around her. Diversity is one of UC Riversideâ€™s greatest gems, and she is glad she is able to take advantage and be more culturally aware and knowledgeable of her surrounding peers; she believes this trait is what allows her to be personable towards everyone.
